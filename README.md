# 🎙️😜 SarcEmotiq
SarcEmotiq is a deep learning-based tool for recognizing sarcasm in English audio. It uses pre-trained models trained on specific datasets (MUStARD++) but also allows users to retrain the model with their own data.

➡️ More information about the model please visit: https://pubs.aip.org/asa/poma/article/54/1/060002/3305267/Improving-sarcasm-detection-from-speech-and-text

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SarcEmotiq.git
   ```
2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. You can choose to use the pre-trained model or retrain the model on your dataset. Details are shown below 👇:

## 🎯  Pre-trained model
Download the pre-trained model from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqyofUELCl2oBlA6151Vvd-f8pIG2biF/view?usp=drive_link]. Place it in the `models/` folder.

### 📂 Inference with Pre-trained Model
To use the sarcasm recognition model on a new audio file (.wav):
   ```bash
   python src/inference.py --input path/to/data --model path/to/model
   ```
⚠️ Note: The audio file should be in .wav format, ranging from 1s to 20s. No need to include the contextual sentence. Check the example under /samples/.

## 🔄 Retrain the model
You can retrain the model with your own dataset. Here's how:

1. First, you need to generate embeddings compatible with the model from your dataset:
   ```bash
   python generate_embeddings.py \
    --audio_directory /path/to/audios \ 
    --text_csv /path/to/text.csv \  #Path to the CSV file containing the audio file keys and text, sample: "/data/mustard++_onlyU.csv"
    --opensmile_path /path/to/opensmile \  #path to OpenSMILE installation directory, default: compare16 
    --output_directory /path/to/store/tmp_audio_features  #Directory where the temporary extracted audio feature files (LLDs) will be stored and removed after processing.
   ```
   📋 Text CSV format:

   ```
   KEY,SENTENCE
   audio1,"This is a test sentence."
   audio2,"Another example of audio transcription."
   ```
   The text_csv file is expected to contain at least two columns:

   KEY: This should be a unique identifier for each audio file, corresponding to the file name (without the .wav extension).

   SENTENCE: This column contains the transcriptions (or textual representations) of the audio files. Each row should correspond to the text spoken in the associated audio file.


2. When the embeddings are generated, you can use the following command to train the model.
The default path for embedding files are under data/.
   ```bash
   python src/train.py --data path/to/your/data --epochs 20 --batch_size 32 --model_path path/to/save/model.pth --lr 0.001
   ```
   You can adjust epochs, batch_size, and lr to your needs.
